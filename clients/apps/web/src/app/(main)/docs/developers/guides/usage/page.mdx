# Credits-based products with Polar

In this guide, we will be creating a Product which grants X amount of credits, which gatekeeps access to an API. It's perfect if you're building an AI application, where you want to deduct credits on every request hitting your API.

## The anatomy of Credits-based products

The requirements of creating a credit-system are:

- A mechanism to authenticate incoming requests
- An incrementation mechanism which runs on subsequent requests

Polar has the "License Key" benefit which can fit both of these requirements.

### License Keys with Credits

When creating a License Key benefit on Polar, you have the option to issue an arbitrary "Usage" limit. This essentially means that you can restrict the License Key to be used a certain amount of times.

In this guide, we will use "Usage" as our "Credits".

Imagine that you want to issue 2000 credits of some kind. We will then essentially configure the License Key to support 2000 Usages.

The nice thing with Polar's License Key benefit, is that we can easily increment usages by an arbitrary amount. It's up to you.
